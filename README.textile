h1. mojito - Next level Ruby webframework

p. Mojito is a lean and simple webframework. 

p. As the name implies mojito derives from cuba (https://github.com/soveran/cuba). Many thanks to Michel and his cuba project for giving me some major insights on web-application-simplicity!

h2. Installing

bc. $ gem install mojito

h2. Your first application

p. The easiest way to start with mojito is to use a plain @config.ru@ script to develop and configure your application. 

bc.. $ cat config.ru
require 'mojito'

class FirstApp
	include	 Mojito
	include Mojito::C::Runtime
	include Mojito::Rendering
	routes do
		on GET(), PATH('/hello/:name') do |name|
			write "Hello #{name}! How are you?"
			content_type :plain
			ok!
		end
	end
end

run FirstApp.to_app

p. This installs a handler for GET requests to a path of /hello/ followed by a name (actually this notation catches everything but a slash '/'). You can start this application by running @rackup@ from the same directory:

bc. $ rackup

p. This starts a http-server on port 9292. Now try to call your handler through curl:

bc. $ curl http://localhost:9292/hello/Fred
Hello Fred! How are you?

p. Please be aware that although this way is easy to start with it tends to get messy very quick if your project becomes more complex, so please read on...

h2. Controllers



h2. Structure of a real-world application

p. *This is not up-to-date*

p. The above call to @Mojito.application@ actually created a class and included most of Mojitos foundation methods, so that you could start writing your application code without wondering what features you want to include in your application. As a tribute to simplicity (one of the most important I think), another helper method @Mojito.base_application@ can be used to create a blank application class, which only includes modules that are strictly necessary. Instead of using those methods you can also write out all of the generated classes code (here @Mojito@ is included, which in turn includes @Mojito::Base@, the basic module which is used by @Mojito.base_application@):

bc.. class FirstApp
	include Mojito
	routes do
		on GET(), PATH('/hello/:name') do |name|
			...
		end
	end
end

p. which is not only perfectly legal but also favoured, when you need any special behaviour on your application class.

p. Although you can actually use any structure you want (including a single-file application), some of them are more useful than others. My preferred way of developing Mojito applications is to reuse most of the concepts found in product development with rubygems and git.

h2. Behind the scenes

p. Understanding how Mojito dispatches requests and selects handlers, which in turn use common functionality to create the response is vital to an efficient use of Mojito as web application framework. First of all Mojito applications (classes which include @Mojito::Base@ or @Mojito@) are simply Ruby classes, which are instantiated with the Rack-environment hash for each request. This is automatically triggered by a rack-enabled webserver through the call of @run ApplicationClass@, which tells rack to call @call(env)@ on that class. The Mojito implementation will then instantiate the Application (the instance is called a _controller_ from now on) and call @dispatch@ on that controller. The dispatch method then executes any block given to the @routes@-method in the class definition. As in Cuba the routes-definition is executed once for each request.

h3. Matching

p. A matcher is simply a Proc, instantiated with matcher-specific configuration, which returns whether or not a given request matches its criteria. The request-method matcher for example is implemented as follows:

bc.. 	def METHOD(method)
	proc { request.request_method == method.to_s.upcase }
end

p. This method configures a Proc to return true when the requests method matches the given parameter. The returned Proc is evaluated in the context of the current controller. This is also where the @request@ method comes from. Like @request@, a matcher can access any method from the controller, within which it is executed. The naming convention is to name all matchers uppercase.

h2. Contributing to mojito
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
