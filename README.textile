h1. mojito - Next level ruby webframework

p. Mojito is a lean and simple webframework. 

p. As the name implies mojito derives from cuba (https://github.com/soveran/cuba). Many thanks to Michel and the cuba sources for giving me some major insights on web-application-simplicity!

h2. Installing

bc. $ gem install mojito

h2. Your first application

p. The easiest way to start with mojito is to use a plain config.ru script to develop and configure your application. 

bc.. $ cat config.ru
require 'mojito'

FirstApp = Mojito.application do
	on GET(), PATH('/hello/:name') do |name|
		write "Hello #{name}! How are you?"
		content_type :plain
		ok!
	end
end

run FirstApp

p. This installs a handler for GET requests to a path of /hello/ followed by a name (actually this notation catches all but a slash '/'). You can start this application by running @rackup@ from the same directory:

bc. $ rackup

p. This starts a http-server on port 9292. Now try to call your handler through curl:

bc. $ curl http://localhost:9292/hello/Fred
Hello Fred! How are you?

p. Please be aware that although this way is easy to start with it tends to messy very quick if your project becomes more complex, so please read on...

h2. Contributing to mojito
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
